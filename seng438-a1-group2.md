# Introduction

As a group in SENG 438 Lab 1, we will familiarize ourselves with three simple testing strategies, 
as well as concepts such as the system under test (SUT) and defect tracking systems.
Firstly, general exploration of the SUT and defect tracking will be performed. Each member will
understand the high level requirements of the software (Appendix B) so that meaningful testing can be done.
Secondly, members will learn how to right detailed and effective bug reports.

The testing methods to be used are:
    1. Exploratory (Manual Non-Scripted) Testing
    2. Manual Scripted Testing
    3. Regression Testing (verification of Defect Fixes)

The exploratory testing will be performed in pairs within the group. In each pair, one student will
perform tests while the other analyzes and records the results. Manual scripted testing will be 
performed as a group, following the test suite provided in Appendix C of the lab document. Finally,
all recorded defects will be re-tested to verify they have been fixed. If bugs persist, they will
be reported and attributed to the new version using the defect tracking system.

Exploratory testing is testing that attempts to create realistic scenarios the system may encouter. Rather than
developing a testing plan, testers will probe the system and execute steps in an iterative manner.
The goal is to create a human-realistic scenario.

Manual scripted testing follows a strict set of instructions developed by the tester. This allows a detailed 
and thorough evaluation of all system functionalities.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

The pair that was made up of Ernest and Jana were part of decided to go for a more general approach to the exploratory
testing. Over the half-hour we tested each function a little bit so as to have time to test all of the 
funcionality. We tested each funcionality in the way a user would normally interact with the system, such as
withdrawing/depositing a normal amount of cash, transfering between valid accounts, and checking the balance
of existing accounts tied to the card. We also tested how the system would behave if the user incorrectly entered
their pin by accident.

Robbe and Josh's goal was to test the basic functionalities in a broad perspective. We separated the functionalites and took each step-by-step.
We imagined how a typical user would expect the system to function, and create scenarios that would test the system.
When a bug was encoutered, we stopped testing, recorded the bug, then proceeded on to higher functionalites.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

Exploratory testing uncovered a lot of bugs, however it was difficult to isoloate their effects. Although exploratory testing
was informative, tracking the causes-and-effects was a little ambiguous. This testing seemed to be effective in identifying the presence
of bugs, but not necessarily the specific locations or causes.

Conversely, manual functional testing was very thorough. The break-down of use cases allows for comprehensive, iterative testing
of all possible input combinations.
