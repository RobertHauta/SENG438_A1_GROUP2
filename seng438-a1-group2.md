# Introduction

As a group in SENG 438 Lab 1, we will familiarize ourselves with three simple testing strategies, 
as well as concepts such as the system under test (SUT) and defect tracking systems.
Firstly, general exploration of the SUT and defect tracking will be performed. Each member will
understand the high level requirements of the software (Appendix B) so that meaningful testing can be done.
Secondly, members will learn how to right detailed and effective bug reports.

The testing methods to be used are:
    1. Exploratory (Manual Non-Scripted) Testing
    2. Manual Scripted Testing
    3. Regression Testing (verification of Defect Fixes)

The exploratory testing will be performed in pairs within the group. In each pair, one student will
perform tests while the other analyzes and records the results. Manual scripted testing will be 
performed as a group, following the test suite provided in Appendix C of the lab document. Finally,
all recorded defects will be re-tested to verify they have been fixed. If bugs persist, they will
be reported and attributed to the new version using the defect tracking system.

Exploratory testing is testing that attempts to create realistic scenarios the system may encouter. Rather than
developing a testing plan, testers will probe the system and execute steps in an iterative manner.
The goal is to create a human-realistic scenario.

Manual scripted testing follows a strict set of instructions developed by the tester. This allows a detailed 
and thorough evaluation of all system functionalities.

    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.
